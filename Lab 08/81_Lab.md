Inspiration:

- https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/sar-basics      → could riff of of this and choose an area relevant to Blacksburg that’s     been undergoing change? 
- https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/observation-scenario 
- https://www.gears-lab.com/intro_rs_lab8/     [needs more context and questions]
- https://un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-google-earth-engine-flood-mapping/step-by-step     → easy tutorial focused on flooding applications. Would be good to add in     some characterization/testing of accuracy
